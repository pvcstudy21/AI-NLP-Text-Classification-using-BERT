# AI-NLP-Text-Classification-using-BERT
This project implements text classification using a pre-trained BERT-based transformer model. It includes data preprocessing, tokenization, model fine-tuning, and evaluation with PyTorch. A custom dataset is created for training, and the fine-tuned model predicts labels for new text inputs.
